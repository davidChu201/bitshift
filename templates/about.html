      <h1><span>&raquo;</span> What</h1>
      <span id="title">bitshift</span> is an <a href="https://github.com/earwig/bitshift">open-source</a>
      online source-code search engine, developed by programmers, for programmers. The engine currently aggregates
      publicly-available code from two online frameworks &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and <a
        href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> &#8211; but has the necessary infrastructure to quickly incorporate
      others, like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> and
      <a href="https://gitorious.org/">Gitorious</a>.  <span id="title">bitshift</span> supports a robust query
      language, which allows users to search for specific languages, files, dates of creation and last modifcation,
      and symbols (function, class, and variable names), amongst other attributes.

      <h1><span>&raquo;</span> How</h1>
      <span id="title">bitshift</span> has an extensive back-end, roughly divided into three sections:
      <ul>
        <li><span>indexer</span> : finds and downloads code from online frameworks</li>
        <li><span>parser</span> : parses newly crawled code, identifying its symbols</li>
        <li><span>database</span> : interprets and compiles user searches into database queries</li>
      </ul>
      The engine was developed over the span of four months, and is primarily implemented in <b>Python</b>, but has
      parsers in <b>Ruby</b>, <b>Java</b>, and a number of other languages.
