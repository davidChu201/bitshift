      <h1><span>&raquo;</span> Usage</h1>
      <p>
        <span id="title">bitshift</span> is a search-engine optimized for source code: beyond supporting searches with the full range of ASCII
        symbols, the engine <em>understands</em> code, allowing users to query for metadata, like time of creation/last
        modification, programming language, and even symbols like function names and variables. Basic use boils down to
        general and advanced searches.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <h2>general search</h2>
            <p>
              To perform a "general search," simply place your cursor in the search bar on our home page and begin
              entering text; when you stop typing for a short period of time, we'll automatically execute the query for you.
              As you scroll down the results page, new codelets will be seamlessly downloaded from our server and
              appended to the end.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>advanced search</h2>
            <p>
              General searches, though, are limited. To allow users to make the best of our engine, we created an advanced
              search form that allows the creation of complex queries with the following specifiers:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <h3>search fields</h3>
                  <ul id="search-fields">
                    <li>
                      <span id="code">languages</span> : The programming languages to search for.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span id="code">authors</span> : Search for code written/modified by a specific person.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span id="code">date last modified</span> : Search for code last modified on a specific date (<span
                        id="code">mm/dd/yy</span> format).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span id="code">date created</span> : Search for code created on a specific date (<span
                        id="code">mm/dd/yy</span> format).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span id="code">symbols</span> : Search for specific symbols.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span id="code">functions</span> : Search for functions with specific names.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span id="code">classes</span> : Search for classes with specific names.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span id="code">variables</span> : Search for variables with specific names.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    Each of the search fields allows for numerous values; just separate them with spaces. If you'd like
                    to search for a multi-word, space-delimited string, on the other hand, enclose it in double quotes.

                    A query for <span id="code">foo bar</span> will search for occurrences of both <span
                      id="string">"foo"</span> and <span id="string">"bar"</span>, while <span id="code">"foo bar"</span>
                    will search for occurrences of <span id="string">"foo bar"</span>.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <h3>search groups</h3>
                  <p>
                    Search groups facilitate even more robust queries: they're like a bunch of individual searches
                    grouped into one. A user searching for occurrenes of symbol <span id="string">"curses"</span> in the
                    language <span id="string">"Python"</span>, and <span id="string">"ncurses"</span> in <span
                    id="string">"C"</span>, won't get away with: <span id="code">symbols: "curses ncurses"</span> and
                    <span id="code">languages: "Python C"</span>. The engine might return results <span
                    id="string">"curses"</span> in <span id="string">"C"</span> and <span id="string">"ncurses"</span> in
                    <span id="string">"Python"</span>!

                    To work around that, you can use two search groups: one for <span id="string">"curses"</span> in
                    <span id="string">"Python"</span>, and another for <span id="string">"curses"</span> in <span
                    id="string">"C"</span>. <span id="title">bitshift</span> will return the union of both sets of search results.
